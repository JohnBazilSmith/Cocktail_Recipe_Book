    <p>
        The <strong>Espresso Martini</strong> is a sophisticated and energizing cocktail.<br>
        It blends the robust flavor of coffee with the crispness of vodka and the sweetness of a coffee liqueur.<br>
        It's a relatively modern classic, believed to have been created in the 1980s by bartender Dick Bradsell<br>
        in London for a model who requested a drink that would "wake me up and then f*** me up."<br>
        Its frothy top and rich aroma make it an appealing after-dinner drink or a pick-me-up.

                <li>1 oz (30ml) <strong>Coffee Liqueur</strong> (e.g., Kahl√∫a, Tia Maria)</li>
                <li>1 oz (30ml) Freshly Brewed <strong>Espresso</strong>, chilled (or strong cold brew concentrate)</li>
                <li>0.5 oz (15ml) <strong>Simple Syrup</strong> (optional, adjust to taste and coffee liqueur sweetness)</li>
                <li>3 whole <strong>coffee beans</strong>, for garnish</li>
            </ul>

        <h3><u>Tools</u>:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Cocktail shaker</li>
                <li>Jigger (measuring tool)</li>
                <li>Strainer (Hawthorne or fine mesh strainer)</li>
                <li>Chilled martini glass or coupe</li>
                <li>Espresso machine</li>

        <br>
    <h2>Now how do you actually make it?</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Chill your glass:</strong> Place a martini glass or coupe in the freezer or fill it with ice water to chill.</li>
                <li><strong>Brew espresso:</strong> Brew a fresh shot of espresso and let it cool completely. You can also use strong cold brew concentrate. Chilling the espresso beforehand helps to prevent over-dilution.</li>
                <li><strong>Combine ingredients:</strong> In a cocktail shaker, add the vodka, coffee liqueur, chilled espresso, and simple syrup (if using).</li>
                <li><strong>Add ice:</strong> Fill the shaker with ice cubes.</li>
                <li><strong>Shake vigorously:</strong> Secure the lid and shake vigorously for at least 15-20 seconds. This is crucial for creating the beautiful frothy head.</li>
                <li><strong>Double strain:</strong> Remove the ice from your chilled glass. Place a Hawthorne strainer over the shaker and then a fine mesh strainer over your glass. Double strain the cocktail into the chilled martini glass or coupe. This removes any small ice shards and helps achieve a smoother froth.</li>
                <li><strong>Garnish:</strong> Float three whole coffee beans on top of the foam. Serve immediately.</li>
            </ol>
