        The <strong>Negroni</strong> is an iconic Italian cocktail, famed for its perfect balance of bitter, sweet, and botanical notes.<br>
        Its vibrant red hue and sophisticated flavor profile make it a popular choice for an aperitif. <br>
        Originated in Italy, in 1919 when Count Camillo Negroni asked his bartender to strengthen his Americano by replacing the soda water with gin.
