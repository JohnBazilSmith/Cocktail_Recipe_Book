    <p>
        The <strong>White Russian</strong> is a creamy and sweet cocktail with a rich, velvety texture and coffee-chocolate notes. <br>
        It's a comforting and satisfying choice, especially after a meal or as a nightcap. <br>
        The cocktail gained significant popularity thanks to the film "The Big Lebowski." <br> 
        It's essentially a variation of the Black Russian, with the addition of cream or milk,<br> transforming it into a smooth, dessert-like drink.
