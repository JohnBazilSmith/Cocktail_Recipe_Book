        The <strong>Negroni</strong> is an iconic Italian cocktail, famed for its perfect balance of bitter, sweet, and botanical notes.<br>
        Its vibrant red hue and sophisticated flavor profile make it a popular choice for an aperitif. <br>
        Originated in Italy, in 1919 when Count Camillo Negroni asked his bartender to strengthen his Americano by replacing the soda water with gin.

                <li>1 oz (30ml) <strong>Sweet Vermouth</strong> (preferably a quality Italian vermouth like Carpano Antica Formula or Martini Rosso)</li>

            </ul>

        <h3><u>Tools</u>:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Mixing glass</li>
                <li>Bar spoon</li>
                <li>Jigger (measuring tool)</li>
                <li>Strainer</li>
                <li>Old Fashioned glass (rocks glass)</li>

    <h2>Now how do you actually make it?</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Chill your glass:</strong> Place an Old Fashioned glass in the freezer or fill it with ice water to chill.</li>
            <li><strong>Combine ingredients:</strong> In a mixing glass, add one large ice cube or several smaller ones. Pour in the gin, Campari, and sweet vermouth.</li>
            <li><strong>Stir thoroughly:</strong> Using a bar spoon, stir the ingredients for about 20-30 seconds. This chills and slightly dilutes the cocktail, helping to meld the flavors.</li>
            <li><strong>Strain:</strong> Remove the ice from your chilled Old Fashioned glass. Place a strainer over the mixing glass and strain the cocktail into the Old Fashioned glass over a large, fresh ice cube (or a few smaller ones).</li>
            <li><strong>Garnish:</strong> Express the oils from an orange peel over the drink by twisting it, then drop the peel into the cocktail. Serve immediately.</li>
        </ol>
