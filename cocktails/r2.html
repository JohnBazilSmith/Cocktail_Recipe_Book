        The <strong>Margarita</strong> is arguably the most popular tequila-based cocktail in the world.<br>
        Celebrated for its vibrant, tangy, and refreshing profile.<br>
        Its perfect harmony of tart lime, sweet orange liqueur,<br>
        and the distinct kick of tequila makes it an irresistible choice for a sunny day,<br>
        a festive gathering, or simply when you crave a bright and zesty drink.<br>
        Often served with a salted rim,<br>
        the Margarita offers a delightful interplay of flavors that dance on the palate.
