Here's a detailed breakdown for each of the classic cocktails you requested:

### Negroni

The Negroni is an iconic Italian cocktail, famed for its perfect balance of bitter, sweet, and botanical notes. Its vibrant red hue and sophisticated flavor profile make it a popular choice for an aperitif. A true classic, it's believed to have originated in Florence, Italy, in 1919 when Count Camillo Negroni asked his bartender to strengthen his Americano by replacing the soda water with gin.

**Ingredients:**

* 1 oz (30ml) Gin
* 1 oz (30ml) Campari
* 1 oz (30ml) Sweet Vermouth (preferably a quality Italian vermouth like Carpano Antica Formula or Martini Rosso)
* Orange peel, for garnish

**Tools Required:**

* Mixing glass
* Bar spoon
* Jigger (measuring tool)
* Strainer
* Old Fashioned glass (rocks glass)
* Large ice cubes

**Step-by-Step Instructions:**

1.  **Chill your glass:** Place an Old Fashioned glass in the freezer or fill it with ice water to chill.
2.  **Combine ingredients:** In a mixing glass, add one large ice cube or several smaller ones. Pour in the gin, Campari, and sweet vermouth.
3.  **Stir thoroughly:** Using a bar spoon, stir the ingredients for about 20-30 seconds. This chills and slightly dilutes the cocktail, helping to meld the flavors.
4.  **Strain:** Remove the ice from your chilled Old Fashioned glass. Place a strainer over the mixing glass and strain the cocktail into the Old Fashioned glass over a large, fresh ice cube (or a few smaller ones).
5.  **Garnish:** Express the oils from an orange peel over the drink by twisting it, then drop the peel into the cocktail. Serve immediately.

The White Russian is a creamy, indulgent cocktail that gained significant popularity thanks to the film "The Big Lebowski." It's essentially a variation of the Black Russian, with the addition of cream or milk, transforming it into a smooth, dessert-like drink.

### Espresso Martini

The Espresso Martini is a sophisticated and energizing cocktail that perfectly blends the robust flavor of coffee with the crispness of vodka and the sweetness of a coffee liqueur. It's a relatively modern classic, believed to have been created in the 1980s by bartender Dick Bradsell in London for a model who requested a drink that would "wake me up and then f*** me up." Its frothy top and rich aroma make it an appealing after-dinner drink or a pick-me-up.

**Ingredients:**

* 1.5 oz (45ml) Vodka
* 1 oz (30ml) Coffee Liqueur (e.g., Kahlúa, Tia Maria)
* 1 oz (30ml) Freshly Brewed Espresso, chilled (or strong cold brew concentrate)
* 0.5 oz (15ml) Simple Syrup (optional, adjust to taste and coffee liqueur sweetness)
* 3 whole coffee beans, for garnish

**Tools Required:**

* Cocktail shaker
* Jigger (measuring tool)
* Strainer (Hawthorne or fine mesh strainer)
* Chilled martini glass or coupe
* Espresso machine or strong coffee brewer

**Step-by-Step Instructions:**

1.  **Chill your glass:** Place a martini glass or coupe in the freezer or fill it with ice water to chill.
2.  **Brew espresso:** Brew a fresh shot of espresso and let it cool completely. You can also use strong cold brew concentrate. Chilling the espresso beforehand helps to prevent over-dilution.
3.  **Combine ingredients:** In a cocktail shaker, add the vodka, coffee liqueur, chilled espresso, and simple syrup (if using).
4.  **Add ice:** Fill the shaker with ice cubes.
5.  **Shake vigorously:** Secure the lid and shake vigorously for at least 15-20 seconds. This is crucial for creating the beautiful frothy head.
6.  **Double strain:** Remove the ice from your chilled glass. Place a Hawthorne strainer over the shaker and then a fine mesh strainer over your glass. Double strain the cocktail into the chilled martini glass or coupe. This removes any small ice shards and helps achieve a smoother froth.
7.  **Garnish:** Float three whole coffee beans on top of the foam. Serve immediately.
